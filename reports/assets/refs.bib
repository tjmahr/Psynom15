  abstract = {Infants differ substantially in their rates of language
              growth, and slow growth predicts later academic difficulties. In this
              study, we explored how the amount of speech directed to infants in
              Spanish-speaking families low in socioeconomic status influenced the
              development of children's skill in real-time language processing and
              vocabulary learning. All-day recordings of parent-infant interactions at
              home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech
              caregivers addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more
              child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words
              in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24
              months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to
              vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of
              child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants'
              language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language
              experience strengthens processing skills that facilitate language
              growth.},

              and later cognitive function is a fundamental question in research on
              human cognition. In a longitudinal study assessing speed of language
              processing in infancy, Fernald, Perfors and Marchman (2006) found that
              reaction time at 25 months was strongly related to lexical and
              grammatical development over the second year. In this follow-up study,
              children originally tested as infants were assessed at 8 years on
              standardized tests of language, cognition, and working memory. Speed of
              spoken word recognition and vocabulary size at 25 months each accounted
              for unique variance in linguistic and cognitive skills at 8 years,
              effects that were attributable to strong relations between both infancy
              measures and working memory. These findings suggest that processing
              speed and early language skills are fundamental to intellectual
              functioning, and that language development is guided by learning and
              representational principles shared across cognitive and linguistic
              domains.},

               of such detailed data are demanding, but well worth the effort,
               revealing a dynamic and nuanced picture of young children's developing

> Abstract: Children learn words by listening to caregivers, and the 
quantity and quality of early language input predict later language 
development. Recent research suggests that lexical processing efficiency 
may mediate the relationship between input and vocabulary growth. We 
asked whether language input and lexical processing at 28-39 months 
predicted vocabulary size one year later in 180 preschoolers. Input was 
measured using adult word counts, conversational turn counts, and 
proportion of meaningful speech and television in the child’s 
environment. Lexical processing was measured using accuracy and rate of 
change on a four-image looking-while-listening eyetracking task. 
Structural equation modeling showed that both input and lexical 
processing predicted vocabulary size, but most of the effect of input 
was mediated by lexical processing. Further, amount of television in the 
environment negatively influenced vocabulary size. These results further 
support the hypothesis that children must efficiently process ambient 
language input to capitalize on learning opportunities. 

> Abstract Number: 1165 

> **Abstract Numbering** You will note that the abstract number assigned to your
poster is a 4-digit number. The first digit codes which session you were
assigned to (1–5; 1 = Thursday evening; 2 = Friday noon; 3 = Friday evening; 4 =
Saturday noon; 5 = Saturday evening). The last 3 digits range between 001 and
200. These digits code your poster location (i.e., 001 is poster #1 within the
session; 002 is poster #2, etc.). So, for example, 4016, is in the Saturday noon
session, board #16.  The boards will be grouped serially in the room to help
participants locate specific presentations.
